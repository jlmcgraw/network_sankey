Currently, this will load 4x Sankey diagrams in a web browser: traffic in/out by bytes/packets

In the future, I'd like to find methods to:
- Display a diagram in native GUI without using browser
- Have a live display of traffic
- Hover over traffic and display the full path of the flow and information about it

## Getting Started
- Install wireshark
  - For MaCOS, its included BPF utility will allow you to capture packets as a regular user
- create/activate a venv
- pip install -r requirements.txt
